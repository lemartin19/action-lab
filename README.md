# action-lab

This is a data collection website created for the Action Lab.
The website was created in order to allow users to play games that measure their reaction and motion prediction remotely. 

The website consists of 6 different games modeled off the lab's own games created in MatLab.
I created the fuctionality from scratch - front end and back end - as my first experiment in web development.
For more details about my own experience creating this project, as well as challenges I faced and things I would do differently, see my website, lemartin19.github.io
